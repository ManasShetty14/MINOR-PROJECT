    "nutritional_advice": "A typical chapati (also known as roti) has about 70-120 calories, depending on its size and thickness. The majority of these calories come from carbohydrates, with a small amount from protein and very little fat. \n\nNutritional Advice:\n1. Whole Grains: Always opt for whole grain flour when making chapatis. Whole grains are full of fiber and help in digestion. They are also more filling than refined grains, which can help control portion size.\n\n2. Control Portions: Even though chapatis are healthy, eating too many can lead to excess calorie consumption. Stick to 1-2 chapatis per meal, balanced with plenty of vegetables and lean protein.\n\n3. Choose Healthy Sides: The nutritional value of a meal with chapati depends largely on what you're eating with it. Opt for lean proteins like chicken or tofu, and plenty of colorful vegetables.\n\n4. Healthy Cooking Methods: Chapatis are often brushed with ghee or butter. While these can provide some healthy fats, they also add a lot of calories. Consider using a small amount or skipping it altogether.\n\n5. Balanced Diet: Remember, chapatis should be part of a balanced diet. Include a variety of other grains, fruits, vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats in your diet for optimal nutrition.\n\nRemember, everyone's nutritional needs are different based on several factors including age, sex, weight, and physical activity level. Always consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice."
