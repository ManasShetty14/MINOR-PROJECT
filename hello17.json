    "nutritional_advice": "A typical samosa, which is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, contains approximately 262 calories. However, the caloric content can vary based on the size, the filling, and the method of preparation.\n\nAs for nutritional advice, samosas are not typically considered a health food. They are often deep-fried and can be high in unhealthy fats and sodium. The filling, while it can contain nutritious ingredients like peas and potatoes, may also contain high amounts of oil or butter. \n\nIf you enjoy samosas and want to include them in a healthier diet, consider these tips:\n1. Opt for baked samosas instead of fried. Baking can greatly reduce the amount of fat and calories.\n2. Choose samosas with vegetable fillings. Vegetables are typically lower in calories and packed with nutrients.\n3. Limit your portion size. Instead of having several samosas, have one with a side of salad or some other nutrient-rich food.\n4. Homemade is always a better option. This way, you can control the ingredients and the amount of oil used in preparation.\n\nRemember, it's important to enjoy what you eat, but also consider the nutritional value of the food. Balance is key to a healthy diet."
