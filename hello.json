    "nutritional_advice": "A standard-sized samosa typically contains between 250 and 300 calories, depending on the specific ingredients and size. However, keep in mind that the nutritional content can also vary. Most samosas are deep-fried and can be high in unhealthy fats and carbohydrates.\n\nNutritionally speaking, it's always better to enjoy such foods in moderation. If you're looking to maintain a balanced diet, it's important to pair foods like samosas with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Additionally, consider opting for baked samosas rather than fried when possible, as this can significantly reduce the calorie and fat content. Try to balance your diet based on your lifestyle, activity level, and nutritional needs. \n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice."
