    "nutritional_advice": "Pakoras, or pakode, are a popular Indian snack that is often deep-fried. The calorie content can vary widely depending on the size and specific ingredients used, but on average, a serving of pakora (about 100 grams) could have around 250-300 calories. \n\nAs for nutritional advice, while pakoras are delicious and can be part of a balanced diet in moderation, they do tend to be higher in fat and calories due to the deep frying process. They are not typically rich in vitamins or minerals either. \n\nHere are some tips if you're watching your calorie intake but still want to enjoy pakoras:\n\n1. Use healthier ingredients: Try adding more vegetables to your pakoras. This will increase their nutritional value and help you feel fuller without adding many calories.\n\n2. Bake or air fry instead of deep frying: This reduces the amount of oil and, therefore, the calories in your pakoras.\n\n3. Portion control: Enjoy your pakoras as a treat, not as a main meal. Stick to a few pieces rather than a large serving.\n\n4. Pair with healthy sides: Instead of pairing pakoras with high-calorie sauces or dips, try a side of fresh vegetables or a low-fat yogurt dip.\n\nRemember, it's always important to maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise."
