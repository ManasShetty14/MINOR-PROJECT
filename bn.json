    "nutritional_advice": "A typical serving of butter naan contains approximately 300 calories, though this can vary depending on size and exact ingredients used. \n\nNutritional advice: While butter naan is delicious, it's also heavy in carbohydrates and fats due to the flour and butter used. It's not high in protein, fiber, or many essential vitamins and minerals. Therefore, it's best to enjoy it in moderation and balance it with protein-rich foods and plenty of fruits and vegetables. If you're watching your calorie intake or have dietary restrictions, consider opting for whole grain variants or roti, which is often less calorific. As with any food, the key is portion control and balance."
